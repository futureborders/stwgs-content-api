  You do not need a FLEGT import licence if you have a [CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) permit or certificate](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-cites-permits-and-certificates-to-trade-endangered-species) to bring CITES specimens into or out of the UK (GB). 
  
  You must travel with the relevant documentation and use a CITES designated Point of Entry/Exit. Documentation must be presented and endorsed by the UK Border Force on entry and exit.
