  Goods that are more than 50 years old need an Export Licence. Exporters should check first if their export is 
  permitted under the Open General Export Licence (OGEL), which is a bulk licence based on value thresholds. If not, 
  the exporter should check whether they hold an Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL). If neither of these apply, then
  the exporter should [apply for a Standard Individual Export Licence from the Arts Council's Export Licensing 
  Unit.](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/export-licensing#section-1)
  
  If the object you are exporting incorporates certain species of animals and plants and their derivatives (e.g. works 
  of art incorporating ivory or plumage) their export is also covered by the Convention on International Trade in 
  Endangered Species (CITES). For advice as to whether CITES export permits are required and how to apply, [contact the
  Animal Health CITES Team](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-cites-permits-and-certificates-to-trade-endangered-species).
  An export licence may also be required from the Department for International Trade (DIT) for cultural goods 
  classified as firearms, military or paramilitary equipment, regardless of monetary value. For advice, [contact the 
  Export Control Joint Unit within DIT.](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/export-control-joint-unit)
