  You need to register with a [UK-approved organic control body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/organic-food-uk-approved-control-bodies) to import organic products.
  
  You must also:
  
  - get a certificate of inspection (COI), signed or stamped by the exporterâ€™s control body, for each consignment of organic goods
  - notify the Port Health Authority (PHA) or Local Authority (LA) that an organic consignment is arriving and must be checked
  - show your certificate of inspection to the PHA or LA when your goods arrive at the port. They will check and stamp the certificate before your goods go to customs for clearance
