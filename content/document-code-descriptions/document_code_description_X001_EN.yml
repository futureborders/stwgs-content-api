  Agricultural goods are classified as 'restricted' so you will need to complete an AGREX licence application form, 
  unless the quantity does not exceed that as stated in Annex part II of EU Regulation 2016/1237. The export licence 
  requirement only applies to NI exports of rice to third countries.
  
  To apply please use the [Export licence application form.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agrex-export-licence-application-form-for-agricultural-products)
