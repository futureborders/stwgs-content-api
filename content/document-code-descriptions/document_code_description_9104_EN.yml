  If you are exporting military or dual-use goods, then you will need to obtain a standard individual export licence or an open general export licences. A standard individual export licence (SIEL), issued by the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU), permits the export of certain strategic controlled items.
  
  A SIEL is specific to an exporter and allows shipments of a stated quantity of specified items to a named consignee or end-user. A consignee is an entity who first receives the items. The end-user is the entity which uses the items or incorporates them into another product or a higher-level system. You will need appropriate supporting documentation to get a SIEL.
  
  Open general export licences (OGELs) are also issued by the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU), part of the Department for International Trade. Check if you can comply with the terms and conditions of an OGEL and register for it on SPIRE. If you cannot comply with the terms and conditions of an OGEL you must apply for a standard individual export licence or open individual export licence (OIEL) on SPIRE.
