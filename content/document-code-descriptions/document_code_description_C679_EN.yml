  There is a ban on importing seal products into the UK, except for items:
  
  - derived from hunts by Inuit or other indigenous communities for their subsistence
  - exclusively for personal use by travellers and their families (worn or contained in luggage, or imported at a later 
  date)
  
  You must provide an attesting document issued by a recognised body to import under the exemption for Inuit or other 
  indigenous communities for their subsistence.
