  If you're [importing high-risk food of non-animal origin (HRFNAO) from non-EU countries into Great Britain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries), you need a common health entry document called CHED-D.
  
  Examples of HRFNAO include:
  
  - peanuts from Bolivia
  - raisins from Turkey
  - coriander from Vietnam
  
  You must [register and login to IPAFFS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system) to:
  
  - complete part 1 of the CHED-D and notify the border control posts that your goods are arriving
  - track any controls or decisions by the authorities relating to the goods
