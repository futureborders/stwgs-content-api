  If youâ€™re importing ammonium nitrate for use as a fertiliser, you need a detonation resistance test certificate issued by a UK-based laboratory accredited to standard ISO 17025.  
  
  [Read the guidance on manufacturing and marketing fertilisers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manufacturing-and-marketing-fertilisers)
  
  If the ammonium nitrate is not intended for use as a fertiliser, you can apply to the Health and Safety Executive for an exemption from the requirement for a detonation resistance test certificate.
