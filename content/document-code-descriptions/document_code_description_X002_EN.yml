  If your goods are intended to be 
  [used by both civilians and the military (‘dual use’)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-controls-dual-use-items-software-and-technology-goods-for-torture-and-radioactive-sources)
  then you may need a licence from the Export Control Joint Unit.
  
  See the [Goods Checker tool](https://www.ecochecker.trade.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire)
  to check if your items are controlled and whether you need an export licence from the Export Control Joint Unit.

  Types of licences for dual-use goods include:
  - Open General Export Licence
  - General Export Authorisation
  - Standard Individual Export Licence
  - Open Individual Export Licence
  
  You may be able to use one of the open general export licences which allows the export of dual use goods to specific
  destinations and removes the need to apply for an individual licence. See the [list of Open General Licences and General Export Authorisations available here](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels#retained-general-export-authorisations).
  
  If the goods are to a destination not covered by OGEL or you cannot meet the terms and conditions of the OGEL, then a
  standard individual export licence (SIEL) or open individual export licence (OIEL) will be needed.
  
  Register for the OGEL or apply for an export licence on 
  [SPIRE, the online export licensing system](https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login).
