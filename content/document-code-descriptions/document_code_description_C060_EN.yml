  If your polyamide or melamine plastic kitchenware is from China or Hong Kong, you must:
  
  - find a [Border Control Post (BCP)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports) thatâ€™s approved to check the goods
  - Contact the Port Health Authority at that BCP to identify which documents to upload and steps to take
  - Tell/pre-notify the BCP when your consignment is due, at least 2 working days before the estimated arrival date
  - have a [declaration](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2011/284/annex) and laboratory report showing the goods do not release primary aromatic amines and formaldehyde into food
  
  The BCP may also carry out laboratory analysis on your goods.
