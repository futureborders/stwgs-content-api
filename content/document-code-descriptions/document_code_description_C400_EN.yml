  If your goods are on the [CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cites-imports-and-exports) list, you need a CITES permit or certificate to move the goods into or out of Great Britain. 
  
  You must make sure that the goods are:
  
  - accompanied by the CITES permit or certificate
  - imported through a [designated air, land or sea port](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-cites-listed-specimens-through-uk-ports-and-airports), where UK Border Force will check and endorse the CITES permit or certificate
